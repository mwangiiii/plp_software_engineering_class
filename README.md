### SE_Day1_Assignment

1. Explain what software engineering is and discusss its importance in the technology industry. 

    > Software Engineering is a branch of computer science that provides the methods to Design, Create and maintain software in a structured and organized way.

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
   
    > 1. **Early computing (1940s -1950s)** - the first programmable computer (ENIAC) was developed and its software was written in machine code.

    > 2. **The birth of Structured programming** - the term software engineering was coined at the NATO Software Engineering Conference to address the growing software crisis that was te inability to produce reliable, efficient software on time and within budget. in 1969, the waterfal model was introduced by Dr. Winston.

    > 4. **Object-Oriented Programming** in 1980, the release of Ada Programming language that was developed by the US Department of Defense. it emphasized reliability and maintainability. In 1983, OOP gained popularity with introduction of C++ that incorporated concepts like Classes, inheritance and polymorphism. This made it easier to build and maintain complex software by organizing code into reusable objects with data and behaviour.

    > 5. **Internet and Agil Methodologies.** - in 2001, Agile manifesto is published emphasizing collaboration, flexibility and customer-focused development over rigid processes. Agile changed the game by focusing on flexibility, collaboration and quick iterations, allowing teams to adapt to changes and deliver software faster.

3. List and explain the phases of SDLC.
   
   >    **planning** this phase ensures that the developer finds out what to do and know if it is possible to build the designated software. The goal is to decide on the project's goals, budget and timeline.
   
   >    **Requirement Analysis** gathering all information that users may need from the software. The goal is to create a list / know what features the software should have so that the user or enduser ca achieve her goal.
   
   > **Design** creating a prototype of how the software can look like and how it is going to work.
   
   > **Implementation** In this phase, the code that is used to develop the software is written.
   
   > **Testing** In this phase, we check if the software works correctly and fixing any issues that may be available in the software. The developer should ensure the software is free of all bugs and meet all requirements.
   
   > **Deployment** This is the releasing of software to the users.
   
   > **Maintainance** fixing the bugs, adding new features and keeping the software upto date / updating th software.

 4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    
    >Agile methodology is used for iterative and incremental approach while *waterfall* method is used for linear and sequential approach.
    
    >*agile methodology* is highly flexible and adaptable to changes while *waterfall methodology* it experiences difficulty to make rigid changes.
    
    >in *agile methodology*, there is customer involvement / high collaboration throughout the development while in *waterfall methodology* there is low customer involvement mainly at the beginning of the development period.
    
    >*agile methodology* is good for complex and evolving projects while *waterfall methodology*, is best for projects with clear and stable requirements.
       > #### **agile methodology** would be appropriate  where:
        1. Requirements are unclear or likely to change.
        2. Where there is need for quick releases and customer feedback
        3. Where there is a large, complex project with evolving needs.

       > #### **Waterfall methodology** would be appropriate  where:
        1. There is a fixed budget, timeline and scope.
        2. where there is high emphasis on documentattion and compliance.
        3. Where it is a simple project with clear, stable requirement.

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

    1. **Software Developer** - they write code that makes the software work. They fix the bugs present and collaborate with others to make sure it works.   

    3. **Quality Asssurance Engineer** - tests the software to prove that all parts of the software work as expected. They test on different devices to ensure the software is compatible.  

    5. **Project Manager** - plan, organize and manage the project to ensure it is completed within time and its allocated budget. They also make sure that everyone knows what he/she is supposed to do.They monitor progress and any issues that come up.
      
7. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each

    **IDE** - contains tools for developers to write and test code. An example is VS code and Intellij idea.
   **Version Control System** - helps developers keep track of the changes in their code, collaborate with other developers and they can manage different versions of a project. An example is Git.

8. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    Inadequate sources for them to so their research when conducting requirement analysis.they should hence expose themselves to the internet and different websites to acquire information of their target population. Additionally, using different research methodology tools to conduct their research by directly interacting with their target through methods such as interviewing and using questionnaires to get and learn the expected functional requrements of the app. 

   AI materials that create websites from scratch may make some juniour software developers discouraged that AI might take over their work. Get good counselling and get exposed to industry mentors to guide them and teach them how to be confident and good software engineers.

   In large systems, bugs might be difficult to identify and fix them. They should hence use Debuggers and conduct unit testing (testing of each segment of the software independently to isolate each part so that they can identify where the issue might be).

   Staying upto date with current technologies. They should hence ensure they have continous self-paced learning to keep up with current trends in tech and the related languages and frameworks.

   Poor communication between the team. they should hence ensure the communication is held in tools like slack, jira etc to ensure information is passed on well and effectively.

9. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
    1. unit testing. This is testing of each section of the app independently.It helps catch mistakes early by ensuring each piece of code works as expected before combining them.
       
    3. Integration testing. is testing how different parts of the code work together. It checks if the parts that worked separately still function properly when they interact with each other
       
    4. System testing is where the entire system as a whole is tested to ensure that the system meets its required / expected requirements.  It ensures the entire software system functions as expected when all components are combined.
       
    5. Acceptance testing is where a software system is evaluated to ensure it meets the requirements and is ready for delivery to end users / clients. it ensures that the system meets business requirements and fulfills the needs of the user.

### Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
    Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting specific, clear instructions to guide AI models in providing accurate and relevant responses. It is important because well-designed prompts help improve the quality of AI interactions, making them more efficient and aligned with user needs.

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
    ##### VAGUE PROMPT:
       "Tell me about dogs."

   ##### IMPROVED PROMPT:
       "Can you provide a brief overview of the most common dog breeds, including their size, temperament, and typical care requirements?"
   
   ##### Explanation
       The improved prompt is more effective because it clearly specifies what information is needed, leading to a focused and relevant response.
